# Advent of Cyber 2025 – Day 1  
## Linux Fundamentals & Command Line Basics

### Lab Overview
This lab introduced basic Linux command-line usage commonly required for cybersecurity and SOC roles. The focus was on navigating the filesystem, viewing files, and understanding how attackers and defenders interact with Linux systems.

### Tools / Environment
- Linux terminal (TryHackMe AttackBox)
- Bash shell

### Key Commands Practiced
- `pwd` – display current directory  
- `ls` – list directory contents  
- `cd` – change directories  
- `cat` – display file contents  
- `whoami` – show current user  
- `history` – view previously used commands  

### What I Learned
- How Linux directory structures are organized
- How to navigate between folders efficiently
- Why Linux knowledge is essential for SOC analysts and penetration testers
- How command history can reveal attacker activity during investigations

### Security Relevance (SOC Perspective)
Linux is heavily used in servers and attacker infrastructure. Understanding basic commands helps SOC analysts:
- Investigate compromised systems
- Analyze logs and suspicious activity
- Respond faster during incidents
