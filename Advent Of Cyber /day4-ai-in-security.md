# Advent of Cyber 2025 – Day 4  
## AI in Cybersecurity (old sAInt nick)

### Lab Overview
This lab introduced how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used in cybersecurity to support detection, analysis, and decision-making, while also highlighting its limitations.

### Tools / Environment
- TryHackMe AttackBox
- AI-assisted security tools (lab environment)

### Tasks Performed
- Interacted with AI-based security features
- Observed how AI analyzes patterns in data
- Reviewed outputs generated by AI tools
- Compared automated results with human judgment

### What I Learned
- How AI can assist in identifying patterns and anomalies
- Common use cases of AI in SOC environments
- Limitations of AI, including false positives and lack of context
- Why human analysts are still required for validation and decision-making

### Security Relevance (SOC Perspective)
AI is increasingly used in SOCs to reduce alert fatigue and speed up analysis. This lab shows how SOC analysts:
- Use AI to assist with log analysis and detection
- Validate AI-generated alerts
- Combine automation with human expertise for effective security operations
