# Advent of Cyber 2025 – Day 3  
## SIEM & Log Analysis (Did You SIEM?)

### Lab Overview
This lab introduced the use of a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system using Splunk. The focus was on understanding how logs are collected, searched, and analyzed to detect suspicious activity.

### Tools / Environment
- Splunk (TryHackMe environment)
- Log data sets
- Web-based SIEM interface

### Tasks Performed
- Explored the Splunk dashboard
- Performed basic search queries
- Filtered logs by time and event type
- Identified suspicious and abnormal log entries

### What I Learned
- What a SIEM is and why it is critical in a SOC
- How logs from different sources are centralized
- How to use basic search queries to investigate events
- How anomalies can indicate potential security incidents

### Security Relevance (SOC Perspective)
SIEM tools are central to SOC operations. This lab demonstrates how SOC analysts:
- Monitor security events in real time
- Investigate alerts using log data
- Detect potential threats through log correlation
- Support incident response with evidence from logs
